This lesson guides you through making websites using [Haunt][haunt] on a web
hosting service GitHub Pages. If you are comfortable interacting with websites
in a web browser, this lesson is for you. Basic understanding of HTML as a
webpage authoring languages is welcome but not a must.

For those already familiar with the ways that version control systems and an
online platform like GitHub can help them track and compare changes to flat
text files, and collaborate with others on projects, GitHub Pages, Codeberg
Pages, GitLab Pages and Sourcehut Pages provide a way to build and host
webpages.

This approach is commonly used to provide documentation for software projects,
and to create blogs and websites for individuals and organisations already used
to working with version control for their other projects.

However, for those taking their first steps towards building sites like this,
the process can be confusing and intimidating.  This tutorial aims to address
this, by providing a step-by-step guide to creating a collection of pages
and combining them into a coherent site using a framework called [Haunt][haunt].

## Outdated Screenshots

Throughout this lesson we will make use and show content and screenshots from
GitHub.com. As an ever evolving platform, GitHub is always adding new features
and new visual elements to its website.

**Screenshots** in the lesson may then become out-of-sync, refer or show content
that no longer exists.

If during the lesson you find **screenshots** that no longer match what you see
in your browser, please [open an issue][haunt-static-site-intro-issues] describing
what you see and how it differs from the lesson content. Feel free to add as many
screenshots as necessary to clarify the discrepancy.
