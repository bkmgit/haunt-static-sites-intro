**An** is in the final months of her Masters program in Digital Humanities.
During her six-month lab internship, she started using a couple of tools
available on GitHub, and became familiar with the interface.  She has really
enjoyed this part of the internship and other technical aspects of her Masters
and now wants to find work in digitization of rare books and other written
material. She wants to increase her online profile as she enters the job market,
and she knows that a personal website and online CV are a good place to start
with this.  An still needs to finish writing her thesis and doesn't have a lot of
time to spare for creating a website from scratch, nor a lot of money to pay for
hosting, domain names, and so on.  This lesson will teach An how to find and use
an existing template to create her personal webpage and online CV, how to write
formatted text and insert images to highlight the skills she has picked up, and
how to host those pages online.
