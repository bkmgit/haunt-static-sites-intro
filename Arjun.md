**Arjun** is a third-year PhD student studying atmospheric chemistry.  He uses
Python in his research every day and keeps all his scripts and files under
version control with Git.  His supervisor is a new group leader and Arjun was
the first PhD student she recruited.  Now that her lab has begun to publish the
results of their research, she has tasked Arjun with setting up a website for
the group.  The time and budget the group has for developing and maintaining
the site are limited, and Arjun wants to make sure his labmates can access and
edit the pages.  He has seen some other labs use GitHub Pages to host their
websites and thinks this is a good opportunity to put his Git skills to work.
After following this lesson, Arjun will be able to create and maintain the
structure of the lab website through GitHub Pages, and begin teaching his
colleagues how to collaborate on the content.
