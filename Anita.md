**Anita** is a newly-certified Carpentries instructor.  A librarian for the
biology library at her institution, she learned to work with HTML when she did
her masters in library science.  Since grad school, she has been picking up
other coding skills and has recently learned R.  The Carpentries instructor who
taught her R encouraged her to take Carpentries Instructor Training.  She has
never used Git before but wants to help edit the Carpentries teaching material
and create new lessons on topics she thinks would be useful for the students
and staff she works with.  After working through this lesson Anita will be
comfortable using Github to modify the Carpentries lessons.
